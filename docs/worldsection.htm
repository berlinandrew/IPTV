<p><b>World section</b> for version beta 3<br>
  <br>
  This part of the documentation will go into depth about the world section infrastructure. 
  The first page that come's up has the full map shown on it, this is done from 
  a gif with hotspots on it. All html for this image with hotspots is in the map.inc 
  file which has to be done manually, it is hoped that once the game is further 
  developed that several maps will be made, each of bigger size though each map 
  will need a seperate towns table to start with in the database.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clicking on one of the area's will bring up that section of 
  the map and theroetically you can have as many level's as you want though the 
  default map is only 2 level's deep. At the bottom of the index page is the top 
  5 people but a simple edit to the world index file would allow more (this may 
  be put in as a variable in later versions with other types of rank's)<br>
  <br>
  Clicking on an area on the bottom level map will bring up the town location 
  page. This show's all the squares in a town and by deafult is set to 15x15 though 
  this can be changed in the town.inc file by changing the $tsize vairable. Each 
  square will have a grafic for the type of building located in that square (though 
  only a few are avauble at the minute), the alt tag that comes up when the mouse 
  is put over the square show's the building id number, name of the building and 
  the owner though more info is planned to be put in there later on, including 
  production levels and what is being made.<br>
  <br>
  Clicking on a square brings up the location page for that exact location. there 
  are several options for this page<br>
  1. some one else owns the building - some stats are given about the building<br>
  2. you own the building - stats are given also some options eg upgrading the 
  building<br>
  3. no one owns it - you get the option to buy the land and build on it.<br>
  <br>
  when you buy land the next time you go to the location you are given the option 
  to build a new type of building, this is all done from the .inc file's in the 
  changeland folder and as you may notice town hall's and captiols (ie type 1 
  buildings) are not avaible. this will change later on so mayors and presidents 
  can build other type 1 buildings like military bases.<br>
