This game which at the time of updating is version beta 3 is a complex webbased 
game created using PHP and Mysql. The aim is to make a world simulation game where 
players can build res, commerce and industry to make money, with some players 
becomming mayors and even presidents. With this version there is a small map with 
3 factions each with 5 towns and a capitol. Each town has 15x15 squares on it 
though this can be increased or decreased with ease.<br>
<br>
this is a very basic look at the game, once i get time i'll make a better intro 
section <br>
